<p>ood Morning With Rosemary!!! was one of Australian Television's first weekday breakfast/variety programs for children,
on TEN Channel 10 (now part of Network Ten) and seen in New South Wales. It was produced and presented live to air by Rosemary Eather.
The two-hour show featured news and live animals. (On one occasion an elephant, apparently counter to plan, walked between the live-to-air 
news reader and the camera, then toward the exit doors, with Rosemary and others chasing after 
this impressive animal "Star"..)</p>
